GeodesicTracer.jl is a tool for calculating geodesic paths in arbitrary space-times. It is currently very much work-in-progress, and breaking changes will be committed (probably) quite regularly, as the interface is redesigned to match changing use cases.

It is part of a larger developing eco-system of *Strong Gravity Codes*, created by members of the University of Bristol Astrophysics Group:

- Fergus Baker (PhD Student)
- Dr. Andrew Young (Supervisor)

with the original intent of modelling reverberation lags around Black Holes, although the scope of this has since broadened significantly.

## Vision

The ongoing aim of this project is to provide a tool for tracing geodesic paths, given only an input metric (*not yet implemented*).

However, there is a catalogue of commonly used spacetimes[^1], which are slowly being added to this project through [ComputedGeodesicEquations.jl](https://github.com/astro-group-bristol/ComputedGeodesicEquations.jl). Such pre-computed geodesic equations are momentarily more efficient than the functions generated by [Symbolics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl) through [DiffGeoSymbolics.jl](https://github.com/astro-group-bristol/DiffGeoSymbolics.jl) by virtue of a better `simplify` in other computer algebra systems.

The spacetimes currently supported are

- Kerr in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates
- Schwarzschild in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates

The last thing to note is an on-going plan to decouple the image renderer from the geodesic tracer, which means a different project must be depended on for creating ray-traced images. This documentation will be updated should this be the case.

## Dependencies

All of the integration problems are solved using the phenomenal work in [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/).
